 * This class represents a student with the following properties:
 * - It has a name (string) and quiz score(s) (int).
 * - It can be constructed with a name, or with a name and a quiz score.
 * - It has an appropriate destructor.
 * - Quiz scores can be added, one at a time, to it with a method addQuizScore.
 * - It has a method getAverageScore() that returns the average
 *      of all scores entered for the student.
 *
 * @example
 * labFour_p3 student("Jack Daniels");
 * student.addQuizScore(100);
 * student.addQuizScore(70);
 * student.addQuizScore(70);
 * Then student.getAverageScore() should return 80, the average of 100, 70,
 * and 70.
